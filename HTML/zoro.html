        Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[9] is the master swordsman (剣豪, kengō?) and combatant of the
        Straw Hat Pirates, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as the
        right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain, Monkey D. Luffy.[20][21][22][23] Formerly a bounty
        hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn
        Arc.[2]

        Born in the East Blue and raised in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is a descendant of the Shimotsuki Family of Wano
        Country and the legendary samurai Ryuma; his grandmother Shimotsuki Furiko, the sister of former daimyo
        Ushimaru, emigrated from Wano to the East Blue.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, Zoro is one of the
        three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster
        Trio".[24][25] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, to honor a promise he made to his
        deceased childhood friend and distant cousin, Kuina.[26]

        In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon
        arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy, to be included among the eleven "Super
        Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before
        the Summit War.[27] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the
        "Worst Generation."[28]

        Zoro gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli120,000,000
        after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc.[17] Following the Raid on
        Onigashima, his bounty was augmented to Beli1,111,000,000
